      "Quranic Verse: 'Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and "
      "forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be "
      "reminded.' (Quran 16:90)"
      "Building houses for the homeless promotes social justice and equity by providing equal access "
